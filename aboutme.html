	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<div class="center">
		<p> As a child I have always had a thing for art ever since I was handed a piece of paper and a pencil and grow more passionate for art when going to college and decided to earn a degree in Fine Art. Along my journey I have learned the skills of photoshop, illustrator, after effects, and indesign and applied it to my art. I still have more to learn, but I intend to keep on getting better and practice everyday. </p>
